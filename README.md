# SILENT SQUEEZE

## Overview
SILENT SQUEEZE is a secure text encryption and decryption tool that uses AES-256 with GCM mode encryption to protect your sensitive information. This application provides a simple interface for encrypting messages that can only be decrypted by someone who has the correct encryption key.

## Features
- AES-256 encryption with GCM mode for high security
- Random encryption key generation
- Simple text encryption and decryption
- Copy encrypted/decrypted text to clipboard with one click
- User-friendly interface

## System Requirements
- Windows operating system
- No additional software required

## Installation
No installation necessary. Simply download and run the `SILENT_SQUEEZE.exe` file.

## How to Use

### Encrypting a Message
1. Launch the SILENT SQUEEZE application
2. Click "Generate Key" to create a random encryption key (or enter your own key)
3. Type or paste your message in the "Input Text" field
4. Click "Encrypt" to encrypt your message
5. The encrypted text will appear in the output field
6. Click "Copy Output" to copy the encrypted text to your clipboard

### Decrypting a Message
1. Launch the SILENT SQUEEZE application
2. Enter the encryption key that was used to encrypt the message
3. Paste the encrypted text into the "Input Text" field
4. Click "Decrypt" to decrypt the message
5. The decrypted text will appear in the output field
6. Click "Copy Output" to copy the decrypted text to your clipboard

### Other Functions
- **Clear All**: Clears all text fields
- **Copy Output**: Copies the encrypted/decrypted text to your clipboard

## Security Information
- SILENT SQUEEZE uses AES-256 encryption with GCM (Galois/Counter Mode) for authenticated encryption
- The encryption is performed locally on your computer; no data is sent to any server
- Anyone with the encryption key can decrypt your messages, so keep your keys secure
- Always securely share encryption keys with your intended recipients through a separate, secure channel

## Troubleshooting
- If decryption fails with an authentication error, the encrypted text may have been altered or you are using an incorrect key
- The program requires the complete encrypted text string without any modifications for successful decryption
